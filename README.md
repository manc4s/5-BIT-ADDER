# 5-BIT-ADDER Project


Created in the VIVADO -version 2024.2 IDE
hardware Basys 3 - fpga board from digilent.

Project is based on the 8bit_adder_circuit.png i created in circuit verse.
I only made the project a 5 bit adder because i wanted to be able to represent both inputs and outputs on the LED's on the bottom of the board and there are only 16.


This is my second project for this board besides some simple gate tests. I wanted to test if I could make this circuit with my limited knowledge of verilog and it came out nice.
